# Sentiment Analysis using SVM and Random Forest

This project contains solutions to various tasks related to sentiment analysis from text data, using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers. The project is organized into three Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the analysis.

## Project Structure

- `NLPQ1-4.ipynb`: This notebook covers the initial questions, including data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and initial classification using SVM.
- `QUESTION_5.ipynb`: This notebook deals with the optimization of preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.
- `QUESTION_5RANDOMFOREST.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on applying and evaluating a Random Forest classifier for the sentiment analysis task.

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file.
Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook).
Follow the instructions and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Results
The results of the sentiment analysis are presented within each notebook, including precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for the classifiers used.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
