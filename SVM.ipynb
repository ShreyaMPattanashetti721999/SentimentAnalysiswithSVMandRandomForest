    "# NLP Assignment 1 (40% of grade): Sentiment Analysis from Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework will involve you implementing functions for a text classifier, which you will train to identify the **sentiment expressed in a text** in a dataset of approx. 27,000 entries, which will be split into a 80%/20% training/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this template you are given the basis for that implementation, though some of the functions are missing, which you have to fill in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions file **NLP_Assignment_1_Instructions.pdf** for details of each question - the outline of what needs to be achieved for each question is as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit all **ipython notebooks and extra resources you need to run the code if you've added them** in the code submission, and a **2 page report (pdf)** in the report submission on QMPlus where you report your methods and findings according to the instructions file for each question."
